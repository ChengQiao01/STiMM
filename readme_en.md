# STiMM â€” Seismic Time-series Masked Modeling
> A Transformer-based framework for **seismic time-series** masked modeling and reconstruction (Seismic Time-series Masked Modeling, **STiMM**).  
> **Out-of-the-box**: includes sample data `data/test_dataset.mat` and pretrained weights `models/ckpt_STiMM.pth`.

## Installation
```bash
conda create -n stimm python=3.11 -y
conda activate stimm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
-**Example dataset**: data/test_dataset.mat is provided with the repository.

-**Custom data**: please refer to the logic in scripts/DataLoad_Train.py and adjust the variable/key names.

-**Convention**:
 -Model input tensor shape: (B, 1, T, X), where T is the time dimension, X is the spatial dimension.

## Quick Start
With the pretrained model downloaded, you can directly run:
```bash
python Test_Seis_Time_Former.py
```
to see pretrained reconstruction results.

### Training
Run with the default config and sample dataset:
```bash
python Train_Seis_Time_Former.py
```

### Testing
Run with sample weights and dataset:
```bash
python Test_Seis_Time_Former.py
```
The script will call scripts/tester.py for evaluation and visualization, saving outputs to results/.
> If you replace weights/data, please modify paths in the script or adjust in the config file.
> Current version requires input shape [B, 1, 2048, 128].
